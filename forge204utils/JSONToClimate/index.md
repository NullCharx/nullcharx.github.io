# Heading 1

Input below the json text for your custom dimension file. Remember that this is ran client-side. 
We recommend you using [misode's dimension generator](https://misode.github.io/dimension/?version=1.20.3) to get the json file.
If you have a json with more than a few hundred entries, please go to [my Forge 1.20.4 utils repo](https://github.com/NullCharx/mc204UTILS/blob/main/json2climate)  and directly download the python script from there. It will run locally too, but way more efficiently.
